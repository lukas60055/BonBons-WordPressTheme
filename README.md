## Starter content
Initial view of a theme with starter content will only happen for “**fresh sites**” – new installs that have not yet had any posts, pages, widgets, or customizer settings updated. This state can be changed. By changing the value of '**fresh_site**' to '**0**' in the database in the '***-options**' table.
### From within WordPress ###
1. Navigate to **Appearance** > **Customize**.
2. Click button **Publish**.

## Create a gallery

Galleries can be created on any page. So that it works properly, just add a photo block or gallery using the page editor, and then check the '**Link to**' option as '**Media file**'.
