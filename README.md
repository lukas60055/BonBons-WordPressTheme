## Starter content
Initial view of a theme with starter content will only happen for “**fresh sites**” – new installs that have not yet had any posts, pages, widgets, or customizer settings updated. This state can be changed. By changing the value of '**fresh_site**' to '**1**' in the database in the '***-options**' table. Then follow the steps below.
### Then from within WordPress ###
1. Navigate to **Appearance** > **Customize**.
2. Click button **Publish**.

## Create a gallery

Galleries can be created on any page. So that it works properly, just add **gallery block** using the page editor. After creating the gallery, we can assign any description to each photo.
